#Dotnet Diagnostic Tools CLI Design


## User workflows

These are canonical examples of the work we'd expect a .Net developer to want to do, and the command line syntax to accomplish that task. The goal is for the steps to be clear, easily discoverable, and unsurprising given the developer's knowledge about the concepts and related tools. Some of the scenarios are marked [Future suggestion] to indicate we have no intention of building such a feature now, but it demonstrates that the CLI design could be reasonably extended.

All of the examples below have the following common setup:

1. A .Net Core application has been built and a runnable binary is available on a given machine
2. An investigator, who may or may not be the original developer, has at least terminal access to the machine where the application runs
3. The dotnet SDK has been installed on the machine (this may not be an assumption we want to keep, but lets assume it is true for now)
4. Source and symbols may or may not exist on the current machine
5. The current machine may or may not be the one on which the build was performed


### Ad-hoc Health Monitoring / 1st Level Performance Triage

The investigator wants to get a high level understanding about how the application is performing. This could be proactive investigation during development, or it could be reacting to testing/user feedback for the application in production. The investigator wants to look at a set of common performance counters printed to the console.

    > dotnet tool install -g dotnet-diag
    > dotnet diag view stats
    'view stats' requires argument: -p|--process-id <id>
    Available .Net Core processes:

     PID  %CPU  %MEM     TIME  COMMAND           ENTRYPOINT

     142   0.1   3.4  1:04:54  /usr/bin/dotnet   Contuso.DiskWatchdog.Main
    ...
    
    > dotnet diag view stats --process-id 1902
          ASP.Net Requests/sec       1915
          ASP.Net Latency (ms)         34   
          CPU (%)                    78.2
          Virtual Memory (MB)        1200
          GC Heap (MB)                784
          Threads                      23
          Threadpool queue length     114
          Exceptions/sec              1.3
          ...
          

What did this do? First we installed our diagnostic tool which is called dotnet-diag using the standard global tools installer. Then we ran the 'view stats' command but forgot to specify a process. The command helpfully indicated the parameter was required and displayed a list of running processes that have a .Net Core runtime loaded. Last we ran the 'view stats' command again with a process id which shows a point in time snapshot of the performance statistics. The exact counters to display are TBD, but assume that the list is context sensitive based on the assemblies loaded in the process. 

**Seeing values that refresh periodically in-place**

    > dotnet diag view stats --processId <id> --monitor
          ASP.Net Requests/sec       1915
          ASP.Net Latency (ms)         34   
          CPU (%)                    78.2
          Virtual Memory (MB)        1200
          GC Heap (MB)                784
          Threads                      23
          Threadpool queue length     114
          Exceptions/sec              1.3
       
      'p' to pause updates, 'r' to resume updates, 'q' to quit



**Seeing different sets of counters [Future suggestion]**

    > dotnet diag view stats --processId <id> --profile runtime

The --profile option could indicate predefined named sets, comma separated lists of counters, or a configuration file that describes


## Open Questions

1. Do we want an alternate installation path that doesn't require the SDK?
2. Do we have a smaller tool which is collector only?
3. Do we support command line response files?
4. Do we support '/' style args that are more common on windows or only '--' style args?


    






## TODO: comments from the earlier thread

Capturing some comments from https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/issues/85 as a starting point
we can edit from. This needs cleanup.

@shirhatti We're thinking it should be part of dotnet-collect since all of the flags and infrastructure would likely be the same and it should have a "top" like interface.

We'll need to decide what things we show (aggregations and counters)

### Pprof

Pprof is both a runtime library used by golang to collect trace data as well as a CLI tool to visualize that data after it has been collected. The CLI tool is the focus here. Snippets below from https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md

Pprof follows the convention Pprof <format\> [options] source. 

Unlike many of the other tools there is no need for a verb because it only does one action, reporting on trace data. Source can be an on-disk file or a URL that is streaming the trace data. Format is flexible enough to include text on the console, file based graphics formats, and optionally starting a web browser to visualize content. 

Interactive terminal use:

    pprof [options] source

Web Interface

    pprof -http=[host]:[port] [options] source

Common options:

- -flat [default], -cum: Sort entries based on their flat or cumulative weight respectively, on text reports.
- -functions [default], -filefunctions, -files, -lines, -addresses: Generate the report using the specified granularity.
- -noinlines: Attribute inlined functions to their first out-of-line caller. For example, a command like pprof -list foo -noinlines profile.pb.gz can be used to produce the annotated source listing attributing the metrics in the inlined functions to the out-of-line calling line.
- -nodecount= int: Maximum number of entries in the report. pprof will only print this many entries and will use heuristics to select which entries to trim.
- -focus= regex: Only include samples that include a report entry matching regex.
- -ignore= regex: Do not include samples that include a report entry matching regex.
- -show_from= regex: Do not show entries above the first one that matches regex.
- -show= regex: Only show entries that match regex.
- -hide= regex: Do not show entries that match regex.


### Jcmd

Java previously had numerous single-role tools such as jhat, jps, jstack, jinfo, etc that did a variety of diagnostic tasks (respectively they show heap analysis, process status, stacks, and runtime/machine info). Starting in Java8 jcmd, a new multi-role tool, offers a super-set of functionality from all those tools. Snippets below are from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr006.html

Jcmd uses a Jcmd <process\_id/main\_class\> <verb> [options] convention. The set of verbs that are supported varies dynamically depending on the version of the java runtime running in the indicated process. This makes jcmd more of a proxy for a CLI in the runtime than a CLI tool in its own right.

	> jcmd
	5485 sun.tools.jcmd.JCmd
	2125 MyProgram
	 
	> jcmd MyProgram help (or "jcmd 2125 help")
	2125:
	The following commands are available:
	JFR.stop
	JFR.start
	JFR.dump
	JFR.check
	VM.native_memory
	VM.check_commercial_features
	VM.unlock_commercial_features
	ManagementAgent.stop
	ManagementAgent.start_local

	GC.class_stats
	GC.class_histogram
	GC.heap_dump

	VM.flags
	VM.system_properties
	VM.command_line
	VM.version
	help


### WPR

The Windows Performance Recorder is a CLI or GUI tool to capture etw traces on windows. Rather than tracing directly in the WPR process, the trace operates similar to a background service and WPR is a front-end that sends commands to modify its operation. Snippets below from  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh448229(v=win.10)

WPR uses the WPR -<verb\> [options] convention.


	wpr {-profiles [<path> [ …]] |
         -start<arguments> |
         -stop<arguments> |
         -cancel |
         -status<arguments> |
         -log<argument> |
         -purgecache |
         -help<arguments> |
         -profiledetails |
         -disablepagingexecutive}


### Perfview

Perfview is CLI or GUI tool that allows collecting, analyzing and viewing ETW traces. 

PerfView uses the PerfView <verb/> [options] CLI convention:

	PerfView [DataFile]
		run CommandAndArgs ...
		collect [DataFile]
		start [DataFile]
		stop
		mark [Message]
		abort
		merge [DataFile]
		unzip [DataFile]
		listSessions
		ListCpuCounters
		EnableKernelStacks
		DisableKernelStacks
		HeapSnapshot Process [DataFile]
		ForceGC Process
		HeapSnapshotFromProcessDump ProcessDumpFile [DataFile]
		GuiRun
		GuiCollect
		GuiHeapSnapshot
		UserCommand CommandAndArgs ...
        ...


PerfView has some commands that manipulate an ongoing trace without keeping the PerfView process running (example: start/stop/mark/abort), other commands that capture traces synchronously (example: collect/run), and then further commands that manipulate or view trace data that is already on disk.

### ProcDump

ProcDump is a tool for capturing one or more process dumps (core file on Linux). Historically it was Windows only but it has recently been made cross-platform. Snippets below are from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump

ProcDump uses CLI convention: ProcDump [options]

	usage: procdump [-a] [[-c|-cl CPU usage] [-u] [-s seconds]] [-n exceeds] [-e [1 [-b]] [-f <filter,...>] [-g] [-h]
     [-l] [-m|-ml commit usage] [-ma | -mp] [-o] [-p|-pl counter threshold] [-r] [-t] [-d <callback DLL>] [-64] <[-w]
     <process name or service name or PID> [dump file] | -i <dump file> | -u | -x <dump file> <image file> [arguments]
     >] [-? [ -e]
	Parameter
	Description
	-a
	Avoid outage. Requires -r. If the trigger will cause the target to suspend for a prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent dump limit, the trigger will be skipped.
	-b
	Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them).
	-c
	CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process.
	-cl
	CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process.
	-d
	Invoke the minidump callback routine named MiniDumpCallbackRoutine of the specified DLL.
	-e
	Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception. Include the 1 to create dump on first chance exceptions.
	-f
	Filter the first chance exceptions. Wildcards (*) are supported. To just display the names without dumping, use a blank ("") filter.
	-g
	Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop).
	-h
	Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds).
	-i
	Install ProcDump as the AeDebug postmortem debugger. Only -ma, -mp, -d and -r are supported as additional options.
	-l
	Display the debug logging of the process.
	-m
	Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump.
	-ma
	Write a dump file with all process memory. The default dump format only includes thread and handle information.
	-ml
	Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value.
	-mp
	Write a dump file with thread and handle information, and all read/write process memory. To minimize dump size, memory areas larger than 512MB are searched for, and if found, the largest area is excluded. A memory area is the collection of same sized memory allocation areas. The removal of this (cache) memory reduces Exchange and SQL Server dumps by over 90%.
	-n
	Number of dumps to write before exiting.
	-o
	Overwrite an existing dump file.
	-p
	Trigger on the specified performance counter when the threshold is exceeded. Note: to specify a process counter when there are multiple instances of the process running, use the process ID with the following syntax: "\Process(<name>_<pid>)\counter"
	-pl
	Trigger when performance counter falls below the specified value.
	-r
	Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5).
	CAUTION: a high concurrency value may impact system performance.
	- Windows 7   : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.
	- Windows 8.0 : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.
	- Windows 8.1+: Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported.
	-s
	Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).
	-t
	Write a dump when the process terminates.
	-u
	Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with -c).
	As the only option, Uninstalls ProcDump as the postmortem debugger.
	-w
	Wait for the specified process to launch if it's not running.
	-x
	Launch the specified image with optional arguments. If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start on the next activation (only).
	-64
	By default ProcDump will capture a 32-bit dump of a 32-bit process when running on 64-bit Windows. This option overrides to create a 64-bit dump. Only use for WOW64 subsystem debugging.
	-?
	Use -? -e to see example command lines.

### Perfmon

Perfmon is a Windows GUI tool that shows interactive performance counters and some reports of system performance. It has a minimal CLI that simply launches different GUI views.
